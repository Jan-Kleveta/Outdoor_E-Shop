                    (the “Buyer”) through the Seller’s Online Store. The Online Store is operated by the Seller on a
                    website located at the internet address [website URL] (the “Website”) through the Website’s
                    interface (the “Store’s Web Interface“).
                </p>
                <p>1.2 The Terms and Conditions do not apply to situations where the person intending to purchase goods
                    from the Seller is a legal entity or a person acting as a sole trader or an independent professional

                    derogating provisions in a Sales Contract take precedence over the provisions of the Terms and

                </p>
                <p>1.4 The provisions of the Terms and Conditions are an integral part of a Sales Contract. A Sales

                <p>1.5 Changes or additions to the wording of the Terms and Conditions may be made by the Seller.

                    of validity of a previous version of the Terms and Conditions.

                <p>3.1 Any presentation of goods placed on the Store’s Web Interface is of an informative nature and the
                    Seller is not obliged to enter into a Sales Contract regarding these goods. The provisions
                    of § 1732(2) of the Civil Code shall not apply.
                </p>
                <p>3.2 The Store’s Web Interface contains information about goods, including the prices of individual
                    items. The prices of goods are listed inclusive of value added tax and all related fees. The prices
                    of goods remain valid as long as they are displayed in the Store’s Web Interface. This provision is
                    without prejudice to the Seller concluding a Sales Contract under individually agreed conditions.
                </p>
                <p>3.3 The Store’s Web Interface also contains information about the costs associated with packaging and
                    delivery of goods, see “Shipping and Payment”. The information about the costs associated with
                    packaging and delivery of goods specified on the Store’s Web Interface only applies to delivery of
                    goods within the Czech Republic.
                </p>
                <p>3.4 The Buyer orders goods by filling in an order form on the Store’s Web Interface. The order form

                </p>
                <p>3.4.1 The goods ordered (the goods ordered are “added” by the Buyer to the electronic shopping cart
                    on the Store’s Web Interface);

                <p>3.4.3 The costs associated with the delivery of the goods (jointly the “Order”).
                </p>
                <p>3.5 Before sending the Order to the Seller, the Buyer can check and change the data entered,
                    including to detect and correct any errors made. The Buyer sends the Order to the Seller by clicking
                    on the “Submit order”[Send the Order] button. The data specified in the Order shall be
                    regarded as correct by the Seller. Upon receipt of the Order the Seller shall immediately notify the
                    Buyer by sending an e-mail to the Buyer’s e-mail address specified in the User Interface or in the
                    Order (the “Buyer’s E-mail Address”).

                    (including in writing or by telephone) where he deems this useful in view of the nature of the Order
                    (quantity of goods, purchase price, estimated shipping costs).
                </p>
                <p>3.7 A contractual relationship between the Seller and the Buyer arises when the receipt (acceptance)
                    of the Order sent by the Seller is delivered to the Buyer’s E-mail Address.
                </p>
                <p>3.8 The Buyer agrees to use distance communication means when concluding the Sales Contract. The
                    costs incurred by the Buyer through the use of distance communication means in connection with the
                    conclusion of the Sales Contract (internet connection and telephone call costs) shall be borne by
                    the Buyer and shall not differ from the basic rate.</p>

                    purchase price of the goods. Unless otherwise stated, the relevant Order number is used as the

                    deemed fulfilled when the relevant amount is credited to the Seller’s account.
                </p>
                <p>4.6 The Seller shall be entitled, especially if the Buyer fails to provide additional confirmation of
                    the Order (as specified in Article 3.6), to demand payment of the full purchase price before sending
                    the goods to the Buyer. The provisions of § 2119(1) of the Civil Code shall not apply.
                </p>
                <p>4.7 Discounts on the price of goods provided by the Seller to the Buyer cannot be combined.</p>

                    no withdrawal is possible from, among others, a Sales Contract for the supply of goods modified
                    according to the wishes of or for the Buyer, from a Sales Contract for the supply of perishable
                    goods and goods irretrievably mixed with other goods after delivery, from a Sales Contract for the

                    constitute the starting point of the time limit where the Sales Contract concerns the delivery of
                    several types of goods or parts. A Notice of Withdrawal from the Sales Contract must be sent to the
                    Seller within the time limit specified in the preceding sentence. The Buyer can use the sample form

                    Seller, even where the standard approach of returning the goods by mail cannot be used due to the
                    specific nature of the goods.</p>

                    withdrawal from the Sales Contract and using the payment method used by the Buyer. The Seller shall
                    also be entitled to return the money paid by the Buyer immediately upon the return of goods made by
                    the Buyer or in another way, providing the Buyer agrees and does not incur any additional costs. If
                    the Buyer has not chosen the least expensive method of goods delivery offered by the Seller, the
                    Seller will reimburse the Buyer for the cost of delivery of goods up to the amount corresponding
                    to the least expensive method of goods delivery offered. If the Buyer withdraws from the Sales
                    Contract, the Seller shall not be obliged to return the money received to the Buyer before the
