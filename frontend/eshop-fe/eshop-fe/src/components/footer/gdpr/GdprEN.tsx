                <p>3. 'Personal data' means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person

                <p>1. The Controller processes the personal data you have provided or the data he obtained when
                    executing your order.</p>

                <p>1. The legal reason for processing personal data is</p>
                <p>- the performance of a contract between you and the Controller under Article 6(1) (b) of the GDPR.</p>

                    obligated to provide personal data (such as name and address) necessary for successfully completing
                    the order. Providing personal data is a requirement for entering into a sales contract and its
                    performance; without providing personal data, the conclusion of a contract or its performance by the
                    Controller is rendered impossible.</p>
                <p>3. The Controller does not perform any automated individual decision-making, as referred to in
