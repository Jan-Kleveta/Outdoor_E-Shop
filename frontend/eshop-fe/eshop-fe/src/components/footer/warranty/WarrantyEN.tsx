                <p>1. To ensure prompt processing of the Buyer's warranty claim, the Seller recommends mailing a written
                    warranty request to the address of the Seller's place of business:
                    [jmeno], [firma], [adresa], ([email]). When submitting a written request, the Buyer should first
                    contact the Seller by e-mail [email], in case the warranty needs to be processed alternatively.
                    The Buyer can use the sample form provided by the Seller.</p>
                <p>2. When making a claim, the Buyer is required to provide, deliver, or state:</p>
                <p>- the proof of purchase (a receipt, an invoice or a warranty certificate) or its copy,</p>
                <p>- the defective product with all accessories, cleaned thoroughly (dirty and smelly products may be
                    sent back to the Buyer),</p>
                <p>- a detailed description of the defect,</p>
                <p>- the preferred method of processing the claim,</p>
                <p>- the Buyer's telephone number, e-mail, or postal address.</p>
                <p>3. The Buyer is obligated to use suitable and sufficiently protective packaging material when sending
                    faulty products by mail.</p>
                <p>4. The Seller confirms the products' acceptance and informs the Buyer of the following procedure.</p>

                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Excluding liability for defects</h3>
                <p>The Seller is not liable for defects in the following cases:</p>
                <p>- the defect is present upon takeover and an adequate sales discount has been given,</p>
                <p>- the product is used, and the defect corresponds to the level of use and wear it showed upon
                    takeover,</p>
                <p>- the defect resulted from the wear caused by regular use or the nature of things (e.g., the
                    expiration of the product's lifetime)</p>
                <p>- the Buyer caused the defect and it resulted from incorrect use, storage, maintenance, the Buyer's
                    intervention or mechanical damage,</p>
                <p>- the defect arose from external events outside the Seller's influence.</p>

                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Article 2</h3>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Making a warranty claim</h3>
                <p>The Buyer has the right to submit a warranty claim to the Seller in every Seller's establishment
                    where the acceptance of the request is possible, taking into account the range of products. He may
                    also submit the request in the Seller's legal seat or the Seller's place of business.</p>
                <p>The Seller ensures an employee authorised to accept warranty requests is always present during
                    business hours. The Buyer may submit to an authorised person listed in the provided proof of
                    purchase, in the receipt or the warranty certificate, if this person is closer to the Buyer or at
                    the Seller's place of business.</p>
                <p>The Buyer is obligated to prove his right to make a warranty claim, primarily by confirming the
                    purchase date with the sales note or by other trustworthy means. As proof, it is possible to use the
                    confirmation of the Seller's obligations arising from defective performance (the guarantee
                    certificate). The Buyer is not entitled to report the same defect repeatedly after an adequate sales
                    discount has been already given.</p>
                <p>If the Buyer encounters real difficulties in exercising his right to make a faulty goods complaint at
                    the designated place, the defect in question may be evaluated differently. If the defective goods
                    are built-in or constitute parts of a real estate and cannot be transported by usual means, the
                    Seller may assess the defect on the spot in agreement with the Buyer or choose another suitable way
                    of assessment. In such a case, the Buyer is obligated to cooperate with the Seller to ensure
                    successful processing.</p>

            <section className="space-y-2">
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Article 3</h3>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Period for making a warranty claim</h3>
                <p>The period to make a claim arising from defective performance is 24 months since the Buyer takes over
                    the product. With used goods, the period may be shortened to 12 months. The reduction of the period
                    to 12 months will be marked in the confirmation of the Seller's obligations arising from defective
                    performance (the guarantee certificate) or in the proof of purchase. After the period's expiry, the
                    Buyer is not entitled to make a claim with the Seller. The Buyer may still claim after more than 24
                    months if both parties have an agreement or the Seller provides an additional quality guarantee
                    beyond his legal responsibilities.</p>
                <p>The Buyer exercises his right to claim for defective goods without undue delay as soon as he
                    discovers the defect. The Seller is not liable for any exacerbation of the damage if the Buyer still
                    uses the product despite knowing about the defect. If the Buyer's claim with the Seller shows
                    legitimate, the time of repair when the Buyer cannot use the product is excluded from the
                    period.</p>
                <p>The Buyer takes into account that in case of the product's replacement under warranty, the period
                    still ends 24 months after the takeover of the purchased product under question (hence no new period
                    starts after replacement).</p>
                <p>The period for making a warranty claim does not act as a calculation of the product's lifetime. The
                    product's lifetime differs based on its properties, maintenance, the correctness and intensity of
                    use, or an agreement between the Seller and the Buyer.</p>

                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Processing a warranty claim</h3>
                <p>The Seller is obligated to resolve the claim immediately. With more complicated claims, he may take
                    up to 3 days. If an expert report is required, the time of its completion is excluded from this
                    period. The Seller is obligated to provide the Buyer with a written confirmation. This confirmation
                    will contain the date and place of submitting, the characteristics of the defect, the preferred
                    method of processing the claim, and the way of informing the Buyer of the result.</p>
                <p>The claim (including defect elimination) shall be processed without undue delay in 30 days from the
                    date of submitting unless the Seller and the Buyer agree on an extension. The expiration of this
                    period without action on the Seller's part is considered a severe breach of contract. The Seller is
                    obligated to confirm the way of processing the claim and its duration in a written form. Once
                    settled, the Seller is not entitled to change the method of processing the claim, unless it is
                    impossible to execute or cannot be performed in time.</p>
                <p>The Buyer is obligated to collect the product within 30 days from the latest possible date when the
                    claim could have been processed. After this period of 30 days, the Seller is entitled to charge the
                    Buyer with an adequate storage fee or privately sell the product at the Buyer's expense. The Seller
                    has to inform the Buyer of this procedure and give him additional time to collect the product.</p>

                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Quality upon takeover</h3>
                <p>The Seller declares that he transfers the product to the Buyer in accordance with Section 2161 of the
                    Civil Code, as such:</p>
                <p>- the thing has the properties stipulated by the parties, and in the absence of such a stipulation,
                    such properties which the Seller or producer described, or which the Buyer expected given the nature
                    of the goods concerned and the advertising presented by the Seller or producer,</p>
                <p>- the thing is suitable to be used for the purpose stated by the Seller or to which the thing of such
                    kind is usually used,</p>
                <p>- the thing has the corresponding quantity, measurement, or weight and meets the requirements laid
                    down by legal regulations.</p>
                <p>If the product does not conform to the requirements mentioned above, the Buyer has the right to a new
                    faultless product. Such a remedy must not be inadequate, given the nature of the defect. If the
                    defect concerns only a part of the thing, the Buyer may require a replacement of this part alone; if
                    impossible, he can withdraw from the contract and demand a full refund. If inadequate given the
                    nature of the defect, mainly when the defect can be eliminated without undue delay, the Buyer is
                    entitled to free repair of the defect.</p>
                <p>If the Buyer does not withdraw from the contract or does not exercise his right to a new faultless
                    product, the right to replacement or repair, he may demand an adequate discount from the sales
                    price. The Buyer is entitled to a fair refund if the Seller cannot deliver a new product free of
                    defects, replace the parts, or repair the product. The Buyer may also require a price reduction if
                    claiming redress would bring him significant inconvenience or if the Seller fails to process the
                    claim within a reasonable time.</p>
                <p>If the defect is discovered within 6 months after the takeover, it is presumed the product was
                    already defective upon takeover.</p>

                <p>The Seller's liability for defects that are a severe or minor breach of contract applies to product defects occurring within 24 months after the takeover and not falling under the previous category listed in Article 5 (the Seller's liability for quality upon takeover). The defect is considered a severe breach of contract if the Buyer would not have concluded the contract had he predicted the defect's occurrence. In other cases, the defect is considered a minor breach.</p>
                <p>If the defect is a severe breach, the Buyer can choose between a new product, repair, adequate sales discount, or withdrawal from the contract (including a full refund). If the defect is a minor breach, the Buyer has the right to free repair or an adequate discount.</p>
                <p>The right to a new faultless product, part replacement, discount, or withdrawal from the contract is applicable regardless of the defect's nature if the Buyer still cannot use the product properly after repair (because the same defect occurs repeatedly).

If the claim is denied as illegitimate, the Buyer (or both parties upon agreement) may engage an expert witness and procure an independent evaluation of the defect.</p>
                <p>If both parties fail to reach an agreement, the Buyer may take to the existing systems of out-of-court settlements of consumer disputes, primarily to the website www.vasestiznosti.cz. The Buyer may also submit his claim to the competent court.</p>
